        <p>I was born in Pittsburgh, my birth name was Andrew Warhola, from a very young age I showed my talent for drawing and painting.</p>

      <div id="slide-4">
        <p>I used to record all my conversations. I even referred to my recorder as "wife".</p>

      <div id="slide-5">
        <p>One of my friends described me as a true workaholic.
            I was haunted by the ambition to become famous and rich. And he knew he could only achieve that American dream by working hard.</p>

      <div id="slide-6">
          <p>The factory served as a film-making studio. I made over 300 experimental underground movies, most of them quite bizarre and some quite pornographic.</p>

        <h2>TWENTIETH CENTURY</h2>
        <h3>This style develops within mass culture and the framework of capitalism and industrial reproduction. Which means that the works that emerged within it, would be influenced, in a certain way, by both currents.</h3>
        <b>Thus, it could be said that we are facing a "reproducible" art, making it accessible to everyone.</b>
        <p>We artists include everyday and popular themes in our work, such as soda bottles.
            It is very common to use techniques such as juxtaposition, collage or photo montage, In Pop art works we will never see the personal imprint of the artist, but his works are treated in the same way as the objects or figures they reproduce, as products.
        </p>
        <p1>One of the most internationally known pop art artists is me, Andy Warhol. My works have crossed eras as icons of a society, of a culture and, ultimately, of the current of Pop Art</p1>
